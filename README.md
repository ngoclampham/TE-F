Tech Stack:
| Syntax | Description |
| ---------- | ---------|
| Python | One of the biggest part of my project, Python is one of the most crucial language. Not only has it been used to link all the pages together, Python also creates interactions, pulls the API into the project, and connects the page to the database.  |
| Flask | As a framework of my website, Flask is what develops the website. If HTML is the base land of a website, then Flask will be the constructor.|
| SQL | During the process, I decided to use a database to store and update my data. SQL is the language I ultilized to do so. |
| HTML | As the backbone of my website, the HTMLs have been used for the main purpose of laying out all the elements, including database, buttons, and many more. |
| CSS | CSS has been the main source of designing my website. It helped my website to be much more appealing.  |
| Javascript | I used Javascript to create the carousel, giving the website a more appealing visually website. |
| API | API is Application Programming Interface. It acts as a communication layer, redirecting the request to the approriate source and passing the response to the users. It gives you random quotes, specifically for this project random quotes from Kanye West. Its purpose is to create a more compelling and engaging entrance for users.|

Progress
| Syntax | Description |
| ---------- | ---------|
| Day1 | In the beginning, I mainly tried to visualize the concept of my project. I was jumping back & forth between skating & eating, as they are two of my biggest hobbies or pleasures. |
| Day2 | As I circle around, I realized I usually do best when I came to what I feel most related. I am someone, who like to be outside(either through skating, walking dogs, or just lurking around) but don't have the chance of going out of town often; moreover, I find myself more connected to the ground I stand on when I know the places around it. Because of that, I chose to create something that someone like me would like to have, which is a list of places that I would be interested in.|
| Challenges | As I've gone through my project, I encountered some problems both in the front end and back end. It goes from database connection, API pulling, and html/css miscellaneous.|
| Solution | I usually relies on the words of wisdom of my coaches when I face challenges.|
